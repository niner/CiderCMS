    return 'varchar';
}

=head2 data

If called from within the management interface, it just returns the data.
If called from the website, it checks for a parameter named "send" and if present, sends an email containing the form data to the given recipient.
The email uses the parent object's "subject" or alternatively "title" attributes as subject. If both are unavailable it's just "Submitted form".

    my ($self) = @_;

    my $params = $self->{c}->req->params;

            Subject => ($self->{object}->property('subject') or $self->{object}->property('title') or 'Submitted form'),
            Data    => (join "\n", map { "$_: $params->{$_}" } sort keys %$params),
