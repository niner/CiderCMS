CiderCMS is a flexible CMS for small to mid sized websites.

The basic idea is that the user can define "types" which can be thought equal
to database tables (which get created) consisting of attributes (columns)
with a template for output and an auto-generated (but customizable) management
interface.

Data is stored in a hierarchical tree like a folder/document/text structure
which reflects the organization of a typical website.

This app needs Module::Install for installation. Then install via standard
perl Makefile.PL && make

Run script/cidercms_server.pl to test the application.

Start with http://localhost:3000/system/create to create the first instance.
The test suite creates a full test instance named test.example and populates it.
